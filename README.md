# ESTbench

Evaluation of Estonian generative models. Benchmark tasks are a selection of BigBench tasks that have been machine translated and then corrected into Estonian. They are then modified to be more appropriate for application within the context of Estonian language, culture, and society.

Datasets: [Benchmark tasks](bencmark_tasks) - contributions are welcome!

Evaluation: TBD
